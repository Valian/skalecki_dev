# About Jakub Skałecki

A living document capturing who I am, what I've done, and how I think.

## The Short Version

I build things and share what I learn. Currently running a bootstrapped SaaS (Postline.ai), contributing to open source (live_vue), and occasionally consulting. I care more about outcomes than code — sometimes the best solution is less software, not more.

## Current Focus (2024-present)

**Founder @ Mind Nexus GmbH** — Building Postline.ai with my co-founder. A bootstrapped SaaS, two years in. This is my "big bet" — if it works, I get to keep building my own products. If not, back to consulting and hunting for the next idea.

**Open Source** — Creator and maintainer of live_vue, which powers Postline behind the scenes. I enjoy building tools that help other developers.

**Writing & Sharing** — I write about whatever I'm currently obsessed with. Lately that's Elixir, Phoenix, and AI-assisted development. The blog gets decent traffic and occasionally opens interesting doors.

## Philosophy & Approach

**Outcomes over code.** I don't romanticize writing code. The goal is to help people accomplish things — sometimes that means building, sometimes deleting, sometimes just having a conversation that reframes the problem.

**Simplicity is hard.** I hate unnecessary complexity. Most software is overcomplicated. I'd rather have three similar lines of code than a premature abstraction.

**Dive deep, share freely.** When I get interested in something, I go deep. Then I write about it, give talks, or build tools. This isn't marketing — it's how I learn and how I give back.

**LLMs change everything.** I believe a single senior developer with the right LLM workflow can now outship what used to require a whole team. I'm actively exploring what this means for how software gets built.

**Bootstrapping > VC (for me).** I want to build sustainable businesses, not growth-at-all-costs startups. Postline is bootstrapped intentionally.

## Technical Journey

**Started in game dev (2013-2014)** — Unity3D mobile games at FueroGames. Learned C#, shipped "Age of Cavemen."

**Python era (2015-2021)** — Scrapy, Django, Flask, ML. Worked at CodiLime (scraping at scale), Sigmoidal (ML engineering, 6 projects), VideoBeat (led team of 6, TV ads optimization SaaS, took ML inference from 8h to 15s).

**Co-founded PvP Center (2016-2021)** — Built real-time esports tournament platform from scratch. Designed architecture, managed 15-server cluster with Docker Swarm + Ansible, led remote team. Still runs with minimal maintenance.

**Elixir transition (2021-present)** — Fell in love with functional programming, Phoenix, LiveView. Now my primary stack. Created live_vue to bridge LiveView and Vue.js.

**AI-assisted development (2023-present)** — Heavy user of LLMs for coding. Actively figuring out how to maximize leverage.

## Skills (Technical)

**Primary:** Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, TypeScript, Vue.js

**Strong:** Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes

**Familiar:** C#, Unity3D, WebGL, React, Angular, AWS, GCP

**Meta:** Architecture, team leadership, DevOps, ML fundamentals

- Technical blog (10k visitors/month at peak)

## Education

**Warsaw University of Technology (2011-2018)**
- Master's: Sentiment Analysis using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
- Bachelor's: Dynamic, Procedural 3D Planets Generation in WebGL

## Personal

- Hobbies: juggling, board games
- GitHub: Valian
- Twitter/X: @jskalc

## Working With Me

I'm direct. I'll tell you when I think you're wrong or when there's a better approach. I ask a lot of questions. I care about shipping things that matter, not padding timesheets or building resume-driven features.

Currently focused on Postline.ai but open to consulting for the right projects — especially Elixir/Phoenix, AI integration, or teams that value simplicity over ceremony.
